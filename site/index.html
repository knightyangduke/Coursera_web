            <p>Hi, today we're finally going to write some code, and I'm gonna walk you through it by showing you how you can use an editor. <br>
                One of the biggest pitfalls I've seen many of my students make is that they listen too carefully to what I'm saying, <br>
                rather than actually trying to dive in and start coding themselves. 
                <br>So while I encourage you to sit back and watch what I'm gonna do right now,
                <br>in a little bit I'm hoping you'll sit down and you'll code with me
            </p>
